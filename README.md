We wanted to create a simple choice-based game to explore the state of society and humanity's relationship with the environment. 

The player is tasked with the job of managing three crucial resources, the economy, the environment, and preventing society from falling apart. You also must keep a good public image, at risk of your higher-ups making decisions for you. You are prompted every turn with a yes-no decision regarding some event or natural disaster, and your resources are affected in various ways based on those decisions you make.

Future features: A huge feature we want to add is key events. We want crises to happen and for the gameplay to reflect the severity of the said crisis. We also want to completely revamp our GUI and add more pixel art, as well as add a background along with music and sound FX that would evolve with the state of the world while you are playing. Public opinion is also something we want to implement, where if it gets low enough riots start giving you negative modifiers.
